> taxize is a taxonomic toolbelt for R and Python

Taxonomy deals with the names of living things - well, in this context, we're dealing with living things. So let's call it biological taxonomy. 

Almost all biologists are likely to deal with names, whether they study a single species or 10 species, or 10,000 species. Organism names are created by people - thus they are messy of course. Two different names can be given to the same species, and two completely different taxonomic groups could have the identical name at different taxonomic ranks. All these problems and more make it so that you of course want to do your taxonomic sleuthing with a powerful, repeatable, for-loopable, tool. 

We created a tool to ease the headache of taxonomy. What makes it possible is the many online taxonomy databases that we can give you an interface to. Take a look at the sources of taxonomic databases we wrap in taxize at the [Sources](/Sources) page.

What can you actually do? Let's take a look.

### R

{% highlight coffee %}
uids <- get_uid(c("Chironomus riparius", "Chaetopteryx"))
out <- classification(uids)
lapply(out, head)
{% endhighlight %}

And you get 

{% highlight coffee %}
[[1]]
                name         rank
1 cellular organisms      no rank
2          Eukaryota superkingdom
3       Opisthokonta      no rank
4            Metazoa      kingdom
5          Eumetazoa      no rank
6          Bilateria      no rank

[[2]]
                name         rank
1 cellular organisms      no rank
2          Eukaryota superkingdom
3       Opisthokonta      no rank
4            Metazoa      kingdom
5          Eumetazoa      no rank
6          Bilateria      no rank
{% endhighlight %}

Awesome eh!?
